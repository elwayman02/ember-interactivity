Using Google's [RAIL model](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#load), 
we learn to focus on the more critical aspects of a page or component 
in order to improve the user's perception application speed. We define 
*Time to Interactivity* to be the time it takes for the user to perceive 
that the application is ready for interaction.

Ember Interactivity allows us to generate latency metrics tailored to this definition; 
specifically, by identifying the critical components required to render a parent 
route or component, we can track load times and identify bottlenecks that are 
critical to the user experience. By focusing on perceived load times, we are 
able to reduce user bounce rates and churn through making the content appear to 
load faster. Some strategies for this involve adding placeholders for necessarily 
long content wait times, but often there is plenty of low-hanging fruit to make 
actual improvements if we have the proper instrumentation to locate these issues.

Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ember Interactivity requires developers to instrument routes and 
critical components in order to report when they have completed rendering.

### Routes

The `route-interactivity` mixin provides instrumentation for 
route latency. This can be added to [all routes](https://github.com/elwayman02/jordan-hawker/blob/master/app/ext/route.js):

```javascript
// ext/route.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import RouteInteractivityMixin from 'ember-interactivity/mixins/route-interactivity';

Route.reopen(RouteInteractivityMixin);
```

```javascript
// app.js
import './ext/route';
```

Alternatively, add the mixin only to the routes you want instrumented:

```javascript
// routes/foo.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import RouteInteractivityMixin from 'ember-interactivity/mixins/route-interactivity';

export default Route.extend(RouteInteractivityMixin);
```

By default, routes will naively report that it is interactive by 
scheduling an event in the `afterRender` queue. The instrumentation 
will take latency of the model hook into account, as well as any 
top-level render tasks This is an easy, but relatively inaccurate 
method of instrumentation. It is only recommended for routes that 
are either low priority for instrumentation or render only basic 
HTML elements with no components.

For better instrumentation, read how to utilize the 
[isInteractive](#isInteractive) method.

Note: The mixins in this addon rely on a number of lifecycle hooks, 
such as beforeModel & didTransition. If you have any issues sending events, 
please make sure you are calling `this._super(...arguments)` in your app when 
utilizing these hooks.

### Components

The `component-interactivity` mixin provides instrumentation for 
component latency. This mixin should be added to all components that 
are required for a route to be interactive. For the most accurate data, 
instrument each top-level component's critical children as well. Non-critical 
components can also be instrumented to understand their own latency, 
even if they are not critical for a route or parent component to render.

Like routes above, we can implement a [basic instrumentation strategy](https://github.com/elwayman02/jordan-hawker/blob/master/app/components/dj-bio.js#L10) 
via the `afterRender` queue. If a component renders only basic HTML elements 
and does not depend on any asynchronous behavior to render, this is an ideal approach: 

```handlebars
// templates/components/foo-bar.hbs
<p>I am a basic template with no child components.</p>
```

```javascript
// components/foo-bar.js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { run } from '@ember/runloop';
import ComponentInteractivity from 'ember-interactivity/mixins/component-interactivity';

export default Component.extend(ComponentInteractivity, {
  didInsertElement() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, this.reportInteractive);
  }
});
```

If your component relies on asynchronous behavior (such as data loading), 
you can delay your `afterRender` scheduling until after that behavior completes.

```javascript
// components/foo-bar.js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { run } from '@ember/runloop';
import ComponentInteractivity from 'ember-interactivity/mixins/component-interactivity';

export default Component.extend(ComponentInteractivity, {
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);
    
    this.loadData().then(() => {
      run.scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, this.reportInteractive);
    });
  }
});
```

For components that rely on their child components to be interactive, 
read how to utilize the [isInteractive](#isInteractive) method.

### isInteractive

In order to instrument latency more accurately, we define the list of 
components we expect to report as interactive in order to complete 
the critical rendering path of the route/component (known as the "subscriber"). 
This is handled by implementing an [`isInteractive` method](https://github.com/elwayman02/jordan-hawker/blob/master/app/routes/music.js#L4-L6) 
in each subscriber. This method is passed a function that will tell you if a reporter is interactive.

```javascript
// routes/foo.js or components/foo-bar.js
isInteractive(didReportInteractive) {
  return didReportInteractive('first-component') && didReportInteractive('second-component');
}
```

Pass `didReportInteractive` the name of a component the subscriber renders 
that is considered critical for interactivity. Once `isInteractive` 
returns true, the relevant tracking events will be fired.

If you expect the subscriber to render multiple instances of the same component 
(e.g. an `#each` loop), you can [pass the expected number](https://github.com/elwayman02/jordan-hawker/blob/master/app/components/github-projects.js#L28-L30) 
to `didReportInteractive`:

```javascript
// routes/foo.js or components/foo-bar.js
isInteractive(didReportInteractive) {
  let count = this.get('someData.length');
  return didReportInteractive('first-component', { count }) && didReportInteractive('second-component');
}
```

If there are multiple interactivity states to consider, simply add those 
conditions to `isInteractive`:

```handlebars
// templates/foo.hbs or templates/components/foo-bar.hbs
{{if someState}}
  {{first-component}}
{{else}}
  {{second-component}}
{{/if}}
```

```javascript
// routes/foo.js or components/foo-bar.js
isInteractive(didReportInteractive) {
  if (this.get('someState')) {
    return didReportInteractive('first-component');
  }
  return didReportInteractive('second-component');
}
```

### Beacons

Often a template has multiple rendering states (e.g. a loading state), 
which may or may not render child components. If such a situation occurs, 
neither basic or complex instrumentation is a perfect fit. To address this, 
Ember Interactivity provides an `interactivity-beacon` component. These 
beacons are simple components that you can append to the end of a template 
block in order to time the rendering of that block.

Provide the beacon with a `beaconId` to give it a unique identifier: 

```handlebars
// routes/foo.js or components/foo-bar.js
{{#if isLoading}}
  <p>Loading...</p>
  {{interactivity-beacon beaconId='foo-loading'}}
{{else}}
  {{first-component}}
  {{second-component}}
{{/if}}
```

Each `beaconId` is prepended with 'beacon:' for use in `didReportInteractive`:

```javascript
// routes/foo.js or components/foo-bar.js
isInteractive(didReportInteractive) {
  if (this.get('isLoading')) {
    return didReportInteractive('beacon:foo-loading');
  }
  return didReportInteractive('first-component') && didReportInteractive('second-component');
}
```

### Tracking

Ember Interactivity sends its events to the `interactivity-tracking` service. 
Use this interface to implement your own integration points for sending data 
to your favorite analytics service. For example, if you want to use [`ember-metrics`](https://github.com/poteto/ember-metrics) 
to send interactivity events to Mixpanel:

```javascript
// app/services/interactivity-tracking.js
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
import InteractivityTrackingService from 'ember-interactivity/services/interactivity-tracking';

export default InteractivityTrackingService.extend({
  metrics: service(),

  trackComponent(data) {
    this.get('metrics').trackEvent('mixpanel', data);
  }

  trackRoute(data) {
    this.get('metrics').trackEvent('mixpanel', data);
  }
});
```

The interface is simple; it just passes through a data object for 
various events, and you can handle them however you like. All data will 
include an `event` name as detailed below; you can map these strings to 
whatever names you prefer for sending to your analytics service.

#### trackRoute

This method is called whenever a route interactivity event is triggered. 
There are three possible events: `routeInitializing`, `routeActivating`, & `routeInitialized`

These events are useful for segmenting your route latency numbers to know 
if bottlenecks are caused by your APIs, the actual content rendering, or 
some upstream app dependency (such as the CDN). Each `trackRoute` event 
passes the following base data:

* event - The name of the event (e.g. `routeInitializing`)
* clientTime - The time the event occurred, formatted as a Float
* destination - The destination route for the transition
* routeName - The name of the route this event belongs to
* lostVisibility - Whether or not the app lost visibility

When `routeName` and `destination` are the same, you are on a leaf route 
(as opposed to a parent route whose hooks trigger as part of the rendering process). 
By default only leaf routes report interactivity, so while all routes will fire 
`routeInitializing` & `routeActivating` events, only leaf routes 
(or routes where `isInteractive` is defined) send `routeInitialized`.

###### Visibility Tracking

Ember Interactivity uses [`ember-is-visible`](https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-is-visible) 
to track if the document loses visibility while the route is loading. This is 
useful because the browser may de-optimize loading some part of your application 
when a user switches tabs to another site. Using this data, we can identify events 
where latency numbers may be increased due to visibility loss, as well as 
track user behavior to know if they are frequently moving away from the site 
while waiting for it to load.  

##### routeInitializing

This event is called from the `beforeModel` hook of your route and 
indicates the beginning of each route's loading phases.

##### routeActivating

This event is called when the `activate` hook is triggered, after the model hooks complete. 
This is the point at which the route will begin scheduling its rendering tasks.

##### routeInteractive

This event is called when the route reports itself as interactive, per the definitions 
outlined above. In addition to the base data, two additional properties are added to this event:

* isAppLaunch - Boolean indicating if the app is launching for first time 
or if this is a transition from another route.
* timeElapsed - This indicates the time (in milliseconds) that the route 
took to become interactive since the initial browser fetch. Only included 
if `isAppLaunch` is true.

`timeElapsed` is usually your primary data point for tracking the load times of your routes.

#### trackComponent

This method is called whenever a component interactivity event is triggered. 
There are two possible events: `componentInitializing` & `componentInteractive`

Event data contains the following properties:

* event - The name of the event (e.g. `componentInteractive`)
* clientTime - The time the event occurred, formatted as a Float
* component - The name of the component
* componentId - A unique id for the component (to differentiate instances of the same component)

The `componentInteractive` event adds an additional property:

* timeElapsed - This indicates the time (in milliseconds) that the component 
took to become interactive since it began initializing. 
(Essentially subtracting the clientTimes for the two events)

##### isComponentInstrumentationDisabled

This method allows you to control whether components are instrumented in the application. 
By default, it reads the configuration property [`tracking.disableComponents`](#Configuration), 
but you can override the method to add custom logic for when to disable instrumentation.

#### trackError (_Experimental_)

This method is called whenever an error occurs in Ember Interactivity. 
Currently, no data is sent along with an error; please file issues if you 
have requests for data to include! `trackError` is only hooked up for routes 
at the moment, such as when a user has transitioned away from the route before completion.

### Timeline Marking

Ember Interactivity automatically marks each route/component using the 
[Performance Timeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_Timeline/Using_Performance_Timeline) 
standard. DevTools such as the [Chrome Timeline](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) 
can display the timings for easy visualization of the critical rendering waterfall. 
This can help developers identify bottlenecks for optimizing time to interactivity.

![Component Waterfall](docs/waterfall.png)

Note: It's important to realize that in some cases, components you may not have
considered to be critical are creating rendering bottlenecks in your application. 
Look for suspicious gaps in the rendering visualization to identify these situations.

### Configuration

Developers can toggle individual features of Ember Interactivity by 
adding an `interactivity` object to their application's environment config. 
This can be useful if you only want features run in certain environments, 
or if you want to sample a percentage of your users to stay within data storage limits.

Three features can be configured:

* `instrumentation` - Toggle instrumentation altogether (Note: Does not support leaf/parent configs below)
* `timelineMarking` - Toggle marking the performance timeline
* `tracking` - Toggle sending tracking events

Each feature can be configured for four subsets of the addon:

* `disableComponents` - Set true to disable for all components
* `disableLeafComponents` - Set true to disable for child components 
(those that do not implement `isInteractive`). This is useful if you 
only want a feature enabled for subscribers (parent routes/components).
* `disableRoutes` - Set true to disable for all routes
* `disableParentRoutes` - Set true to disable for all non-leaf routes 
(those that are not the target of a transition). This is useful if you 
aren't trying to identify bottlenecks in your route chain and just want 
to collect latency numbers for each transition.

```javascript
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function (environment) {
  let ENV = {
    interactivity: {
      tracking: {
        disableLeafComponents: true
      },
      timelineMarking: {
        disableRoutes: true
      }
    }
  };
  return ENV;
};
```

#### Overrides

### Testing

Ember Interactivity provides a number of test helpers to support testing your application's latency instrumentation.

#### Mock Services

Mock service instances are provided for your use. It is recommended to 
register these mock services in each of the tests of your application.

```javascript
import MockInteractivityService from 'ember-interactivity/test-support/mock-interactivity-service';
import MockInteractivityTrackingService from 'ember-interactivity/test-support/mock-interactivity-tracking-service';

module('foo', 'Integration | Component | foo', function (hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  hooks.beforeEach(function () {
    this.owner.register('service:interactivity', MockInteractivityService);
    this.owner.register('service:interactivity-tracking', MockInteractivityTrackingService);
  });
});
```

To avoid writing this for every test in your application, you can write 
a wrapper around `module` that handles registering any mock services for your tests.

#### Interactivity Assertions

The `assert-interactivity` helper provides methods to test that your routes/components 
are correctly reporting latency events when rendering. As your tests exercise 
these modules, these assertions will confirm the interactivity events get sent. 
This helper relies on the `MockInteractivityService` being registered.

First, make the assertion available to your tests:

```javascript
// tests/test-helper.js
import 'ember-interactivity/test-support/assert-interactivity';
```

Then, use the `trackInteractivity` assertion in your tests for routes and component subscribers:

```javascript
// tests/acceptance/foo.js
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { click, fillIn, visit } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Acceptance | foo', function (hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);

  test('should report interactive', async function (assert) {
    await visit('/foo');
    assert.trackInteractivity('foo');
  });
});
```

Let's say you want to simulate some async behavior and make sure interactivity 
conditions aren't being fulfilled prematurely. The `trackNonInteractivity` 
assertion can be used to test this scenario:

```javascript
// tests/acceptance/foo.js
import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { click, fillIn, visit } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Acceptance | foo', function (hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);
  
  hooks.beforeEach(function () {
    this.resolveAsyncBehavior = () => {
      // Do stuff to resolve interactivity conditions
    };
  });

  test('should report interactive', async function (assert) {
    await visit('/foo');
    assert.trackNonInteractivity('foo');
    this.resolveAsyncBehavior();
    assert.trackInteractivity('foo');
  });
});
```
